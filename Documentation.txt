This is the documentation for the Open Test Project
The project is meant to be easy to expand upon, and it is up to the user to document any hardware or software changes made

------------------------Python GUI Settings------------------------
CSV Filename: 
Sets the filename for the output file. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, it will be written on it instead.
By default it appends "OTP" at the end of the filename. This can be changed in the python code

port:
Set the port that will be used for communication. Has a default value that can be changed or removed through the variable in the script

frequency:
Set the frequency that will be used for communication. Has a default value that can be changed or removed through  the variable in the script

------------------------Arduino User Variables------------------------

stepperDelay:
range: int
Sets the stepper duration (ms). Smaller number would mean faster stepping

maxAllowedForce:
range: float
Sets a max allowed force for the entire system. If exceeded the system stops. Assumes correct calibration of the load cell

useMaxAllowedForce:
range: true/false
Says wheter to use the maxAllowedForce system or not


------------------------Arduino Test Variables------------------------

idle:
range: true/false
Tells the system if testing should start or not. Recommended to be set to false at the end of testing

mode:
Range 0-3 by default,
Sets the mode of the program to the specifed number. Some modes don't use all variables. See Included modes for more details

stepDirection:
range: 0-1,
Sets the direction of the stepper motors. Which way is up or down depends on how they are wired

measuringIntervall:
range: float
Sets how often in seconds a measurement should be read. A lower number will 
Included modes:

maxForce:
range: float
Sets the force for which to stop the test, or lighten the force depending on the mode

timeAtMaxForce:
range: float   
Sets how in seconds long the system should wait at maxForce for mode 3

restForce:
range: float 
Defines the force at which the system should start increasing it again

timeAtRestForce:
range: float
Sets how long the system should wait at restForce:for mode 3

repeatsDone:
range: int
Sets how many times the system should repeat the increase and decrease in force for test mode 3 

------------------------Modes------------------------
Mode 0: Idle mode
Required variables: none
A mode where the load value is simply read

Mode 1: Default test mode
Required variables: stepdirection, measuringIntervall
A mode where the stepper motor run in the defined direction, and load value is read at set interval

Mode 2: Test mode with a max allowed force
Required variables: stepdirection, measuringIntervall, maxForce
Same as mode 1, but the measuring stops at a spesifed value

Mode 3: Test mode with repeats
Required variables:stepdirection, measuringIntervall, maxForce, timeAtMaxForce, restForce, timeAtRestForce, repeatsDone
Mode where the object is taken up to a force, held there for a defined duration, then reduced to a lower force and held there for a separately defined duration.
This repeats a defined amount of times
